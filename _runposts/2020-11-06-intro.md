The best way to get to know a city is on your feet. Whenever I travel to a new city, I prefer to walk the streets over going into museums or shops. I love looking at all of the architecture, street art, and street culture. 

Being locked in/around my apartment, I realized I only knew the streets in pockets of San Francisco. This spring I was injured running which pushed me to walk different streets and I loved it (I usually avoid as many hills as possible while running). SF has some of the best residential architecture in the world. The houses are unique and varied throughout every neighborhood. And the neighborhoods also all have their own vibe. 
So, I decided to take on the challenge of running every street in SF. 

I am far from the first person to tackle this project. Tom Graham (https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Tom-Graham-walks-every-street-in-San-Francisco-3182272.php#photo-2319225), Ricky Gates(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzMiAkk2ywQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_W5qsjB5U), among other have also tackled this project.

Over the next ??? years, my goal is to run the full length of every street in San Francisco. I want to get to know the city better and find new favorite vistas, parks, houses, and streets. There are 2,612 streets in SF. So, let's get started.
