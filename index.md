I am a computational structural biologist with a special interest in understand how proteins motions impact mutations and ligand and protein binding. I have built and applied new modeling of protein structures to detect the positions of residues together with the motion of these residues. Using this modeling I uncovered that protein entropic compensation is a common phenomenom in ligand binding. My goal is to develop methods to improve modeling protein motions and to apply it to systems characterized by various perturbations or well described by various genomic techniques.

I am currently on the academic job market. My research program will create new ways to model and measure conformational ensembles of macromolecules and solvent. These tools will quantify how conformational entropy modulates free energies, contributing to binding specificity, allostery, and catalysis. This research program will provide an unparalleled platform to comprehensively examine macromolecular interactions' mechanisms.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Biophysics at the University of California San Francisco in [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) building software tools to detect dynamics from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structures. Many of these dynamics occur at timescales that can only be uncovered by looking at the noise in high resolution X-ray cyrstallography or cryo-EM structures. My current challenge I am trying to overcome is modeling partially occupied water molecules in multiconformer structures. This will allow us to examine the energetics of water molecules in a more high throughput way.

I am supported by the [Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program), and the D.E. Shaw Award for Computational Chemistry.

Previously, I was a computational biologist in [Eli Van Allen's lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Broad Institute. My work involved understanding the connection between tumor/germline genetics and response to therapy in genitourinary cancers. Before that, I was a Research Data Specialist in the Genitourinary Department at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute where I managed clinical and translational projects in the Bladder Cancer Research Center. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Outside of science, I love biking and running around the Bay Area. On the weekends, I am frequently hiking or skiing the Mountains.
