I am a computational structural biologist with a special interest in combining high throughput genomic data with structural data, especially with methods that can provide insight into protein dynamics and allostery. By combining these two field, along with machine learning, I think we can uncover new ways to classify cancer mutations. I love to create and use computational tools from different fields to answer questions we cannot currently probe using experimental methods. My current challenge I am trying to overcome is modeling partially occupied water molecules in multiconformer structures. This will allow us to examine the energetics of water molecules in a more high throughput way.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California San Francisco in [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) building software tools to detect dynamics from static X-ray crystallography structures. Many of these dynamics occur at timescales that can only be uncovered by looking at the noise in high resolution X-ray cyrstallography or cryo-EM structures. My goal is to develop methods to improve modeling these dynamics and to apply it to systems characterized by various perturbations or well described by various genomic techniques.

I am currently supported by a [Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program).

Previously, I was a computational biologist in [Eli Van Allen's lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Broad Institute. My work involved understanding the connection between tumor/germline genetics and response to therapy in genitourinary cancers. Before that, I was a Research Data Specialist in the Genitourinary Department at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute where I managed clinical and translational projects in the Bladder Cancer Research Center. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Outside of science, I love biking and running around the Bay Area. I am a proud member of [November Project](https://november-project.com/) San Francisco (#justshowup). On the weekends, I am frequently hiking or skiing the Mountains.
