I am a structural biologist interested in understanding how protein motions impact mutations and ligand and protein binding. I have built and applied new modeling of protein structures to detect the positions of residues together with the motion of these residues. Using this modeling, I uncovered that protein entropic compensation is a common phenomenon in ligand binding. My goal is to develop methods to improve modeling protein motions and to apply them to systems characterized by various perturbations or well-described by various genomic techniques.

I am on the academic job market! My research program will create new ways to model and measure conformational ensembles of macromolecules and solvent. These tools will quantify how conformational entropy modulates free energies, contributing to binding specificity and catalysis. This research program will provide an unparalleled platform to comprehensively examine macromolecular interactions' mechanisms.

Currently, I am a scientist at the University of California San Francisco in [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) (where I also got my Ph.D.), examining the concept of conformational entropy. Conformational entropy is the residual entropy that persists in the protein's native state conformational ensemble as it fluctuates between related conformations. I have created new modeling techniques to detect dynamics from X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM structure showing that protein conformational entropy can modulate the free binding energy by at least 1-2 kcal/mol (about the equivalent of a hydrogen bond) and am interested in applying this to enzyme binding and catalysis. 

The current challenge I am trying to overcome is modeling partially occupied water molecules in multiconformer structures. This will allow us to examine the energetics of water molecules in a more high throughput way. 

I am also testing our ideas on conformational entropy prospectively, applying it to ligand design.

During my Ph.D., I was supported by the [Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program), and the D.E. Shaw Award for Computational Chemistry.

Previously, I was a computational biologist in [Eli Van Allen's lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Broad Institute. My work involved understanding the relationship between tumor/germline genetics and response to therapy in genitourinary cancers using high throughput RNA, whole exome, and whole genome sequence. 

<br>
Prior to that, I served as a Research Data Specialist in the Genitourinary Department at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, overseeing clinical and translational projects for the Bladder Cancer Research Center. I hold a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Outside of science, I love running and biking around the Bay Area. On the weekends, I am frequently hiking or skiing in the Mountains.
