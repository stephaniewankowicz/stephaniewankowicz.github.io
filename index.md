<h1 class="text-center">Stephanie A. Wankowicz</h1>

<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a computational structural biologist with a special interest in combining high throughput genomic data with structural data. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California San Francisco in James Fraser's lab (FraserLab.com) building software tools to detect dynamics from static X-ray crystallography structures.  
Previously, I was a computational biologist in Eli Van Allen's lab (vanallenlab.dana-farber.org) working to understand the connection between tumor and germline genetics and response to therapy in genitourinary cancers. Before that, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 
Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about food and cooking, coffee, 3D printing, and games.
