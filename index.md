I am a computational structural biologist with a special interest in combining high throughput genomic data with structural data. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California San Francisco in [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) building software tools to detect dynamics from static X-ray crystallography structures. 

<br>
<br>

I am currently supported by a [Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

<br>

Previously, I was a computational biologist in [Eli Van Allen's lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) working to understand the connection between tumor and germline genetics and response to therapy in genitourinary cancers. Before that, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Outside of science, I love biking and running around the Bay Area. I am a frequent participant in San Francisco [November Project](https://november-project.com/). On the weekends, I am frequently hiking or skiing the Sierra Nevada.
